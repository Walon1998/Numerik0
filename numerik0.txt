Exercise 0.1
a) Two's complement numbers

b) IEEE 754
x = s*m*b^e

x = Zahl
s = Vorzeichen (1 bit)
m = Mantissa (23 bit)
b = Basis (Usually b =2)
e = Exponent (8 bit)


Exercise 0.2

d) No because power and fast_power can only handle int as b and fast_power doesn't have the same accuracy as pow,
since it does some "unnecessary" computation.

e) power and fast_power somewhere around e-16 while fast_fast_power around e-14
power has the best accuracy, since it doesn't use unnecessary computation which decreases accuracy.
